alices adventures in wonderland lewis carroll the millennium fulcrum edition chapter i down the rabbit hole alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank and of having nothing to do once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading but it had no pictures or conversations in it and what is the use of a book thought alice without pictures or conversations so she was considering in he row mind as well as she could for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid whether the pleasure of making a daisy chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her there was nothing so very remarkable in that nor did alice think its o very much out of the way to hearth e rabbits a to itself oh dear oh dear i shall be late when she thought it over afterwards it occurred to her thats he ought to have wondered at this but at the time it all seemed quite natural but when the rabbit actually took a watch out o fits waistcoat pocket and looked at it and then hurried on alice started to her feet for it flashed across her mind thats he had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat pocket or a watch to take out o fit and burning with curiosity she ran across the field after it and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a larger a bit hole under the hedge in another moment down went alice after it never once considering o win the world she was to get out again the rabbit hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way and then dipped suddenly down so suddenly that alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well either the well was very deep or she fell very slowly for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next first she tried to look down and make out whats he was coming to but it w a stood a x to see anything then she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book shelves here and theres hes a w ma sand pictures hung upon pegs she took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed it was labelled orange marmalade but to her great disappointment it was empty shed id not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it well thought alice to herself after such a fall as this i shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs how brave theyll all think meat home why i wouldnt say anything about it even if i fell off the top of the house which was very likely true down down down would the fall never come to an end i wonder how many miles ive fallen by this times he said aloud i must be getting somewhere earth e centre of the earth let me see that would be four thousand miles down i think for you see alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom and thought his was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge as there was no one to listen to her still it was good practice to say it o very e thats about the right distance but then i wonder what latitude or longitude ive got to alice had no idea what latitude was or longitude either but thought they were nice grand words to say presently she began again i wonder if i shall fall right through the earth how funny itll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward the antipathies i think she was rather glad there was no one listening this time a sit didnt sound at all the right word but i shall have to ask them what then am e of the country is you know please maam is this new zealand or australia and she tried to curtsey as she spoke fancy curtseying as youre falling through the air do you think you could manage it and what an ignorant little girls hell think me for asking no itll never do to ask perhaps i shall see it written up somewhere down down down there was nothing else to do so alices o on began talking again dinahll miss m every much to night i should think dinah was the cat i hope theyll remember her saucer of milk at tea time dinah my dear i wish you were down here with me there are no mice in the air im afraid but you might catch a bat and thats very like a mouse you know but do cats eat bats i wonder and here alice began to get rather sleepy and went on saying to herself in a dreamy sort of way do cats eat bats do cats eat bat sand sometimes do bats eat cats for you see as she couldnt answer either question it didnt much matter which ways he put its he felt thats he was dozing of fan d had just begun to dream thats he was walking hand in hand with dinah and saying to her very earnestly now dinah tell met he truth did you ever eat a bat when suddenly thump thump down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves and the fall was over alice was not a bit hurt and she jumped upon to her feet in a moments he looked up but it was all dark overhead before her was another long passage and the white rabbit was still in sight hurrying down it there was not a moment to be lost away went alice like the wind and was just in time to hear its a a sit turned a corner o hm years and whiskers how late its getting she was close behind it when she turned the corner but the rabbit was no longer to be seen she found herself in along low hall which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof there were doors all round the hall but they were all locked and when alice had been all the way do w none side and up the other trying every doors he walked sadly down the middle wondering how she was ever to get out again suddenly she came upon a little three legged table all made of solid glass there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key and alices first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall but alas either the locks were too large or the key was too small but at any rate it would not open any of them however on the second time round she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high she tried the little golden key in the lock and to her great delight it fitted alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage not much larger than a rat hole she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw how she longed to get out of that dark hall and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains but she could not even get her head through the doorway and even if my head would go through thought poor alice it would be of very little use without my shoulders oh how i wish i could shut up like a telescope i think i could if i only knew how to begin for you see so many out of the way things had happened lately that alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible there seemed to be no use in waiting by the little doors o she went back to the table half hoping she might find another key on it o rat any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes this times he found a little bottle on it which certainly was no there before said alice and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label with the words drink me beautifully printed on it in large letters it was all very well to say drink me but the wise little alice was not going to do that in a hurry no ill look first she said and see whether its marked poison or not for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them such as that are d hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife it usually bleeds and she had never forgotten that if you drink much from a bottle marked poison i tis almost certain to disagree with you sooner or later however this bottle was not marked poison so alice ventured to taste it and finding it very nice it had in fact a sort of mixed flavour of cherry tart custard pine apple roast turkey toffee and hot buttered toast sh every soon finished it off what a curious feelings a id alice i must be shutting up like a telescope and so it was indeed she was now only ten inches high and her face brightened pat the thought thats he was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden first however she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further she felt a little nervous about this for it might end you knows a id alice to herself in my going out altogether like a candle i wonder what i should be like then and she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing after a while finding that nothing more happened she decided on going into the garden at once but alas for poor alice when she got to the doors he found she had forgotten the little golden key and when she went back to the table for its he found she could not possibly reach its he could see it quite plainly through the glass and she tried her best to climb upon e of the legs of the table but it was too slippery and when she had tired herself out with trying the poor little things at down and cried come theres no use in crying like thats a id alice to herself rather sharply i advise out o leave off this minutes he generally gave herself very good advice though sh every seldom followed it and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into here ye sand once she remembered trying to box he row ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people but its no use now thought poor alice to pretend to be two people why theres hardly enough of me left to make one respectable persons o on here ye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table she opened it and found in it a very small cake on which the words eat me were beautifully marked in currants well ill eat it said alice and i fit makes me grow larger i can reach the key and i fit makes me grow smaller i can creep under the doors o either way ill get into the garden and i dont care which happens she a tea little bit and said anxiously to herself which way which way holding her an dont he top of her head to feel which way it was growing and she was quite surprised to find thats he remained the same size to be sure this generally happens w he none eats cake but alice had got so m chin to the way of expecting nothing but out of the way things to happen that it seemed quite d x land stupid for life to go on in the common ways o shes e t to work and very soon finished off the cake chapter ii the pool of tears curiouser and curiouser cried alices he was so much surprised that for the moments he quite forgot how to speak good english now im opening out like the largest telescope t hate v e was good bye feet for when she looked down at her feet they seemed to be almost out of sight they were getting so far off o hm poor little feet i wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now dears im sure i shant be able i shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you you must manage the best way you can but i must be kind to them thought alice or perhaps they wont walk the way i want to go let me see ill give them a new pair of boots every christmas and she went on planning to herself how she would manage it they must go by the carrier she thought and how funny itll seem sending presents to ones own feet and how odd the directions will look alices right foot esq hearthrug earth e fender with alices love oh dear what nonsense im talking just then her head struck against the roof of the hall in fact she was now more than nine feet i hands eat once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door poor alice it was as much as she could do lying down o none side to look through into the garden with one eye but to get through was more hopeless t a never shes at down and began to cry again you ought to be ashamed of yourself said alice a great girl like you she might well say this to go on crying in this way stop this moment i tell you but she went on all the same shedding gallons of tears until there was a large pool all round her about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall after a times he heard a little pattering of feet in the distance and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming it was the white rabbit returning splendidly dressed with a pair of white kid gloves i none hand and a large fan in the other he came trotting along in a great hurry muttering to himself a she came oh the duchess the duchess oh wont she be savage i five kept her waiting alice felt so desperate thats he was ready to ask help o fan ones o when the rabbit came near hers he began in a low timid voice if you pleases i the rabbits tart e d violently dropped the white kid gloves and the fan and skurried away into the darkness as hard a she could go alice took up the fan and gloves and as the hall was very hot she kept fanning herself all the times he went on talking dear dear how queer everything is today and yesterday things went on just as usual i wonder i five been changed in the night let me think was i the same when i got up this morning i almost think i can remember feeling a little different but if im not the same the next question is who in the world am i ah thats the great puzzle and she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself to see if she could have been changed o ran of them im sure im not ada she said for her hair goes in such long ringlets and mine doesnt go in ringlets at a land im sure i cant be mabel for i know all sorts of things and she oh she knows such a very little besides shes she and im i and oh dear how puzzling it all is ill try if i know all the things i used to know let me see four times five is twelve and four times six is thirteen and four times seven is oh dear i shall never get to twenty at that rate however the multiplication table doesnt signify lets try geography london is the capital of paris and paris is the capital o from e and rome no thats all wrong im certain i must have been changed for mabel ill try and say how doth the little and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons and began to repeat it but her voice sounded hoarse and strange and the words did not come the same as they used to do how doth the little crocodile improve his shining tail and pour the waters of then i e on every golden scale how cheerfully he seems to grin how neatly spread his claws and welcome little fishes in with gently smiling jaws im sure those are not the right words said poor alice and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on i must be mabel after a land i shall have to go and live in that poky little house and have next to no toys to play w i than do ever so many lessons to learn no ive made up my mind about it if im mabel ill stay down here itll be no use their putting their heads down and saying come up again dear i shall only look up and say who am i then tell me that first and then if i like being that person ill come up if no till stay down here till im somebody else but oh dear cried alice with a sudden burst of tears id o wish they would put their heads down i am so very tired of being all alone here as she said this she looked down at her hands and was surprised to see thats he had put o none of the rabbits little white kid gloves whiles he was talking how can i have done thats he thought i must be growing small again she got up and went to the table to measure herself by it and found that as nearly as she could guess she was now about two feet high and was going on shrinking rapidly she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding and she dropped it hastily just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether that was a narrow escape said alice a good deal frightened at the sudden change but very glad to find herself still in existence and now for the garden and she ran w it hall speed back to the little door but alas the little door was shut again and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before and things are worse t a never thought the poor child for i never was so small as this before never and i declare its too bad that i tis as she said these words her foot slipped and in another moments x as she was up to her chin in salt water her first idea was thats he had somehow fallen into these a and in that case i can go back by railway she said to herself alice had been to the seaside once in her life and had come to the general conclusion that wherever you got o on the english coast you find a number of bathing machines in these a some children digging in the sand with wooden spades then a row of lodging houses and behind them a railway station however she soon made out thats he was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high i wish i hadnt cried so much said alice as she swam about trying to find her way out i shall be punished for it now i suppose by being drowned in my own tears that will be a queer thing to be sure however everything is queer today just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way of fan d she swam nearer to make out what it was at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus but then she remembered how small she was now and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself would it be o fan use now thought alice to speak to this mouse everything is soo to the way down here that i should think very likely it can talk at any rate theres no harm in trying so she began o mouse do you know the way out of this pool i am very tired of swimming about here o mouse alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouses he had never done such a thing before but she remembered having seen in her brothers latin grammar a mouse of a mouse to a mouse a mouse o mouse the mouse looked at her rather inquisitively and seemed to her to wink with one o fits little eyes but it said nothing perhaps it doesnt understand english thought alice i daresay its a french mouse come over with william the conqueror for w it hall her knowledge of history alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened so she began again ou est ma chatte which was the first sentence in her french lesson book the mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water and seemed to quiver a love with fright oh i beg your pardon cried alice hastily afraid thats he had hurt the poor animals feelings i quite forgot you didnt like cats not like cats cried the mouse in a shrill passionate voice would you like cats if you were me well perhaps not said alice in a soothing tone dont be angry about it and yet i wish i could show you our cat dinah i think youd take a fancy to cats if you could only see hers he is such a dear quiet thing alice went on half to herself as she swam lazily about in the o o land she sits purring so nicely by the fire licking her paw sand washing her face and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse and shes such a capital one for catching mice oh i beg your pardon cried alice again for this time the mouse was bristling a love and she felt certain it must be really offended we wont talk about her any more if youd rather not we indeed cried the mouse who was trembling down to the end of his tail as if i would talk on such a subject our family always hated cats nasty low vulgar things dont let me hearth e name again i wont indeed said alice in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation are you are you fond of of dogs the mouse did not answers o alice went on eagerly there is such a nice little dog near our house i should like to show you a little bright eyed terrier you know with oh such long curly brown hair and itll fetch things when youth row them and itll sit up and beg for its dinner and all sorts of things i cant remember half of them and it belongs to a farmer you know and he says its so useful its worth a hundred pounds he says it kills all t her at sand oh dear cried alice in a sorrowful tone im afraid ive offended it again for the mouse was swimming away from her as hard a sit could go and making quite a commotion in the pool a sit went so she called softly after it mouse dear do come back again and we wont talk about cats or dogs either if you dont like them when the mouse heard this it turned round and swam slowly back to her its face was quite pale with passion alice thought and it said in a low trembling voice let us get to the shore and then ill tell you my history and youll understand why i tis i hate cat sand dogs it was high time to go for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it there were a duck and a dodo a lory and an eaglet and several other curious creatures alice led the way and the whole party swam to the shore chapter iii a caucus race and along tale they were indeed a queer looking party that assembled on the bank the birds with draggled feathers the animals with their fur clinging close to them and all dripping wet cross and uncomfortable the first question of course wash o w to get dry again they ada consultation about t i sand after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to alice to find herself talking familiarly with them as if she had known them all her life indeed she had quite along argument with the lory who at last turned sulky and would only say i am older than you and must know better and this alice would not allow without knowing how old it w a sand as the lory positively refused to tell it sage there was no more to be said at last the mouse who seemed to be a person of authority among them called out sit down all of you and listen to me ill soon make youd x enough they all sat down at once in a larger in with the mouse in the middle alice e there yes anxiously fixed on it for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if shed id not get dry very soon ahem said the mouse w i than important air are you all ready this is the driest thing i know silence all round if you please william the conqueror whose cause was favoured by the pope was soon submitted to by the english who wanted leaders and had been o flat e much accustomed to usurpation and conquest edwin and morcar the earls of mercia and northumbria ugh said the lory with a shiver i beg your pardon said the mouse frowning but very politely did you speak not i said the lory hastily i thought youd id said the mouse i proceed edwin and morcar the earls of mercia and northumbria declared for him and even stigand the patriotic archbishop of canterbury found it advisable found whats a id the duck found it the mouse replied rather crossly of course you know what it means i know what it means well enough when i find a things a id the duck its generally a frog or a worm the question is what did the archbishop find the mouse did not notice this question but hurriedly went on found it advisable to go with edgar atheling to meet william and offer him the crown williams conduct at first was moderate but the insolence of his normans how are you getting on now my dear it continued turning to alice a sit spoke as wet as ever said alice in a melancholy tone it doesnt seem to dry meat all in that case said the dodo solemnly rising to its feet i move that the meeting adjourn for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies speak english said the eaglet i dont know the meaning of half those long words and whats more i dont believe youd o either and the eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile some of the other birds tittered audibly what i was going to says a id the dodo in an offended tone was that the best thing to get us dry would be a caucus race what is a caucus race said alice not thats he wanted much to know but the dodo had paused as i fit thought that somebody ought to speak and no on eels e seemed inclined to say anything why said the dodo the best way to explain i tis to do it and as you might like to try the thing yourself some winter day i will tell you how the dodo managed it first it marked out a race course in a sort of circle the exact shaped o e x t matter it said and then all the party were placed along the course here and there there was no one two three and away but they began running when they liked and left off when they liked so that it was note as to know when the race was over however when they had been running half an hour or so and were quite dry again the dodo suddenly called out the race is over and they all crowded round it panting and asking but who has won this question the dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought and its at for along time with one finger pressed upon its forehead the position in which you usually see shakespeare in the pictures of him while theres t waited in silence at last the dodo said everybody has won and all must have prizes but who is to give the prizes quite a chorus of voices asked why she of course said the dodo pointing to alice with one finger and the whole party at once crowded round her calling out in a confused way prizes prizes alice had no idea what to do and in despair she put her hand in her pocket and pulled out a box of comfits luckily the salt water had not got into it and handed them round as prizes there was exactly one a piece all round but she must have a prize herself you knows a id the mouse of course the dodo replied very gravely w hate x e have you go tiny our pocket he went on turning to alice only a thimble said alices a d x hand it over here said the dodo then they all crowded round her once more while the dodo solemnly presented the thimble saying we beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble and when it had finished this short speech they all cheered alice thought the whole thing very absurd but they all looked so grave thats he did not dare to laugh and as she could not think of anything to says he simply bowed and took the thimble looking as solemn as she could the next thing was to eat the comfits this caused some noise and confusion as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back however it was over at a stand they sat down again in a ring and begged the mouse to tell them something more you promised to tell me your history you knows a id alice and why i tis you hate can d d she added in a whisper half afraid that it would be offended again mine is along and a sad tales a id the mouse turning to alice and sighing i tis along tail certainly said alice looking down with wonder at the mouses tail but why do you call its ada d she kept on puzzling about it while the mouse was speaking so that her idea of the tale was something like this fury said to a mouse t a them e t in the house let us both got o law i will prosecute you come ill taken o denial we must have a trial for really this morning ive nothing to do said the mouse to the cur such a trial dears i with no jury or judge would be wasting our breath ill be judge ill be jury said cunning old fury ill try the whole cause and condemn out o death you are not attending said the mouse to alice severely what are you thinking of i beg your pardon said a i c every humbly you had got to the fifth bend i think i had not cried the mouse sharply and very angrily a knot said alice always ready to make herself useful and looking anxiously about her oh do let me help to undo it i shall do nothing of the sorts a id the mouse getting up and walking away you insult me by talking such nonsense i didnt mean it pleaded poor alice but youre so easily offended you know the mouse only growled in reply please come back and finish your story alice called after it and the others all joined in chorus yes pleased o but the mouse only shook its head impatiently and walked a little quicker what a pity it wouldnt stay sighed the lory as soon a sit was quite out of sight and an old crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter ah my dear let this be a lesson to you never to lose your temper hold your tongue ma said the young crab a little snappishly youre enough to try the patience o fan oyster i wish i had our dinah here i know id o said alice aloud addressing nobody in particular shed soon fetch it back and who is dinah if i might venture to ask the questions a id the lory alice replied eagerly for she was always ready to talk about her pet dinahs our cat and shes such a capital one for catching mice you cant think and oh i wish you could see her after the birds why shell eat a little bird as soon as look at it this speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party some of the birds hurried of fat once one old magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully remarking i really must be getting home the night air doesnt suit my throat and a canary called out in a trembling voice to its children come away my dears its high time you were all in bed on various pretexts they all moved of fan d alice was soon left alone i wish i hadnt mentioned dinahs he said to herself in a melancholy tone nobody seems to like her down here and im sure shes the best cat in the world o hm dear dinah i wonder if i shall e verse e you any more and here poor alice began to cry again for she felt very lonely and low spirited in a little while however she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance and she looked up eagerly half hoping that the mouse had changed his mind and was coming back to finish his story chapter iv the rabbits end in a little bill it was the white rabbit trotting slowly back again and looking anxiously about a sit went as i fit had lost something and she heard it muttering to itself the duchess the duchess o hm dear paws o hm fur and whiskers shell get me executed as sure as ferrets are ferrets where can i have dropped them i wonder alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves and sh every good naturedly began hunting about for them but they were nowhere to be seen everythings e em e d to have changed since hers w im in the o o land the great hall with the glass table and the little door had vanished completely very soon the rabbit noticed alice as she went hunting about and called out to her in an angry tone why mary ann what are you doing ou there run home this moment and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan quick now and alice was so much frightened thats her an of fat once in the direction it pointed to without trying to explain the mistake it had made he took me for his housemaid she said to herself as she ran how surprised hell be when he finds out who i am but id better take him his fan and gloves that is if i can find them as she said this she came upon a neat little house on the door of which was a bright brass plate with then am e w rabbit engraved upon its he went in without knocking and hurried upstairs in great fear lest she should meet there a mary ann and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves how queer it seems alices a id to herself to be going messages for a rabbit i suppose dinahll be sending me on messages next and she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen miss alice come here directly and get ready for your walk coming in a minute nurse but ive got to see that the mouse doesnt get out only i dont think alice went on that theyd let dinahs top in the house i fit began ordering people about like that by this times he had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window and on it as she had hoped a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves and was just going to leave the room when here ye fell upon a little bottle that stood earth e looking glass there was no label this time with the words drink me but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips i know something interesting is sure to happens he said to herself whenever i eat or drink anything so ill just see what this bottle does id o hope itll make me grow large again for really im quite tired of being such a tiny little thing it did so indeed and much sooner than she had expected before she had drunk half the bottle she found her head pressing against the ceiling and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken she hastily put down the bottle saying to herself thats quite enough i hope i shant grow any more a sit is i cant get out at the door id o wish i hadnt drunk quite so much alas it w a stool ate to wish thats he went on growing and growing and very soon had to kneel down on the floor in another minute there was not even room for t i sands he tried the effect o flying down with one elbow against the door and the other arm curled round her head still she went on growing and as alas t resource she x tone arm out of the window an done foot up the chimney and said to herself now i can do no more whatever happens what will become of me luckily for alice the little magic bottle had now had its full effect and she grew no larger still it was very uncomfortable and as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again no wonder she felt unhappy it was much pleasanter at home thought poor alice w he none wasnt always growing larger and smaller and being ordered about by mice and rabbits i almost wish i hadnt gone down that rabbit hole and yet and yet its rather curious you know this sort of life id o wonder what can have happened to me when i used to read fairy tales i fancied that kind of thing never happened and nowhere i am in the middle of one there ought to be a book written about me that there ought and when i grow up ill write one but im grown up now she added in a sorrowful tone at least theres no room to grow up any more here but then thought alices hall i never get any older than i am now thatll be a comfort o new a never to be an old woman but then always to have lessons to learn oh i shouldnt like that oh you foolish alices he answered herself how can you learn lessons in here why theres hardly room for you and no room at all o ran lesson books and so she went on taking first one side and then the other and making quite a conversation o fit altogether but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside and stopped to listen mary ann mary ann said the voice fetch m em gloves this moment then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs alice knew it was the rabbit coming to look for her and she trembled till she shook the house quite forgetting thats he was now about a thousand times as large as the rabbit and had no reason to be afraid o fit presently the rabbit came up to the door and tried to open it but as the door opened inwards and alices elbow was pressed hard against it that attempt proved a failure alice heard its a to itself then ill go round and get in at the window that you wont thought alice and after waiting till she fancied she heard the rabbit just under the window she suddenly spread out her hand and made a snatch in the airs he did not get hold of anything but she heard a little shriek and a fall and a crash of broken glass from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber frame or something of the sort next c a mean angry voice the rabbits pat pat where are you and then a voices he had never heard before sure then im here digging for apples yer honour digging for apples indeed said the rabbit angrily here c o mean d help me out of this sounds of more broken glass now tell me pat whats that in the window sure its an arm yer honour he pronounced it arrum an arm you goose whoever a won e thats i e why it fills the whole window sure it does yer honour but its an arm for all that well its got no business there at any rate go and take it away there was along silence after t i sand alice could only hear whispers now and then such as sure i dont like it yer honour at all at all do as i tell you you coward and at last she spread out her hand again and made another snatch in the air this time there were two little shrieks and more sounds of broken glass what a number of cucumber frames there must be thought alice i wonder what theyll do next as for pulling me out of the window i only wish they could im sure i dont want to stay in here any longer she waited for some time without hearing anything more at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels and the sound of a good many voices all talking together she made out the words wheres the other ladder why i hadnt to bring x tone bills got the other bill fetch i there lad here put em pat this corner not i e em together first theyd on t reach half high enough yet oh theyll do well enough dont be particular here bill catch hold of this rope will the roof bear mind that loose slate oh its coming down heads below aloud crash now who did that it was bill i fancy whos to go down the chimney nay i shant youd o it that i wont then bills to go down here bill the master says youre to go down the chimney oh so bills got to come down the chimney a she said alice to herself shy they seem to put everything upon bill i wouldnt be in bills place for a good deal this fireplace is narrow to be sure but i think i can kick a little she drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could and waited till she heard a little animals he couldnt guess of whats or t it was scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her then saying to herself this is bills he gave one sharp kick and waited to see what would happen next the first things he heard was a general chorus of there goes bill then the rabbits voice along catch him you by the hedge then silence and then another confusion of voices hold up his head brandy now dont choke him how was i told fellow what happened to you tell us all about it last came a little feeble squeaking voice thats bill thought alice well i hardly known o more thank ye im better now but im a deal too flustered to tell you all i know is something comes at me like a jack in the box and up i goes like ask rocket so youd id old fellows a id the others we must burnt he house down said the rabbits voice and alice called out as loud as she could if youd o ill set dinah at youth e e was a dead silence instantly and alice thought to herself i wonder what they will do next if they ada x sense theyd take the roof off after a minute or two they began moving about again and alice heard the rabbits a a barrowful will do to begin with a barrowful of what thought alice but she had not long to doubt for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window and some of them hit her in the face ill put a stop to this she said to herself and shouted out youd better not do that again which produced another dead silence alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor and a bright idea came into her head if i e a tone of these cakes she thought its sure to makes o me change in my size and a sit cant possibly make me larger it must make me smaller i suppose so she swallowed one of the cakes and was delighted to find thats he began shrinking directly as soon as she was small enough to get through the doors her an out of the house and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside the poor little lizard bill was in the middle being held up by two guinea pigs who were giving it something out of a bottle they all ma dear us hat alice the moments he appeared but she ran off as hard as she could and soon found herself safe in a thick wood the first thing ive got to do said alice to herself as she wandered about in the wood is to grow to my right size again and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden i think that will be the best plan it sounded an excellent plan no doubt and very neatly and simply arranged the only difficulty was thats he had not the smallest idea how to set about it and whiles he was peering about anxiously among the trees a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry an enormous puppy was looking down at her with larger ou d eye sand feebly stretching ou tone paw trying to touch her poor little things a id alice in a coaxing tone and she tried hard to whistle to it but she was terribly frightened all the t i meat the thought that it might be hungry in which case it would every likely to eat her up in spite o fall her coaxing hardly knowing whats he did she picked up a little bit of stick and held it out to the puppy whereupon the puppy jumped into the air of fall its feet at once with a yelp of delight and rushed at the stick and made believe to worry it then alice dodged behind a great thistle to keep herself from being run over and the moments he appeared on the others id e the puppy made another rush at the stick and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold o fit then alice thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart horse and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet ran round the thistle again then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick running a very little way forwards each t i mean d along way back and barking hoarsely all the while till at last its at down a good way off panting with its tongue hanging out o fits mouth and its great eyes half shut this seemed to alice a good opportunity for making her escape so shes e to fat once and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath and till the puppys bark sounded quite faint in the distance and yet what a dear little puppy it was said alice as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself and fanned herself with one of the leaves i should have liked teaching it tricks very much if if id only been the right size to do it oh dear id nearly forgotten that ive got to grow up again let me see how i sit to be managed i suppose i ought to eat or drink something or other but the great question is what the great question certainly was what alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass but shed id not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances there was a large mushroom growing near her about the same height as herself and when she had looked under it and on both sides o fit and behind it it occurred to her thats he might as well look and see what w a son the top o fits he stretched herself upon tiptoe and peeped over the edge of the mushroom and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar that was sitting on the top with its arms folded quietly smoking along hookah and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else chapter v advice from a caterpillar the caterpillar and alice looked at each other for some time in silence at last the caterpillar took the hookah out o fits mouth and addressed her in a languid sleepy voice who are you said the caterpillar this was not an encouraging opening for a conversation alice replied rather shyly ii hardly knows i just at present at least i know who i was when i got up this morning but i think i must have been changed several times since then what do you mean by thats a id the caterpillars t e x explain yourself i cant explain myself im afraid sir said alice because im not myself you see i dont see said the caterpillar im afraid i cant put it more clearly alice replied very politely for i cant understand it myself to begin w i than d being so many different sizes in ada is very confusing it isnt said the caterpillar well perhaps you havent found its o yet said alice but when you have to turn into a chrysalis you will some day you know and then after that into a butterfly i should think youll feel it a little queer wont you not a bit said the caterpillar well perhaps your feelings maybe different said alice all i know i sit would feel very queer to me you said the caterpillar contemptuously who are you which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation alice felt a little irritated at the caterpillars making such very short remarks and she drew herself up and said very gravely i think you ought to tell me who you are first why said the caterpillar here was another puzzling question and as alice could not think o fan good reason and as the caterpillars e em e d to be in a very unpleasant state of mind she turned away come back the caterpillar called after her ive something important to say this sounded promising certainly alice turned and came back again keep your temper said the caterpillar is that all said alice swallowing down her anger as well as she could no said the caterpillar alice thoughts he might as well wait as she had nothing else to do and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing for some minutes it puffed away without speaking but at last it unfolded its arms took the hookah out o fits mouth again and said so you think youre changed do you im afraid i am sir said alice i cant remember things as i used and i dont keep the same size for ten minutes together cant remember what things said the caterpillar we live tried to say how doth the little busy bee but it all came different alice replied in a very melancholy voice repeat you are old father williams a id the caterpillar alice folded her hands and began you are old father william the young man said and your hair has become very white and yet you incessantly stand on your head do you think at your age i tis right in my youth father william replied to hiss on i feared it might injure the brain but now that im perfectly sure i have none why id o it again and again you are old said the youth as i mentioned before and have grown most uncommonly fat yet you turned a back somersault in at the door pray what is the reason of that in my youth said the sage a she shook his grey locks i kept all my limbs very supple by the use of this ointment one shilling the box allow met o sell you a couple you are old said the youth and your jaws are too weak for anything tougher than suet yet you finished the goose with the bones and the beak pray how did you manage to do it in my youth said his father i took to the law and argued each case with my wife and the muscular strength which it gave to my jaw has lasted theres to my life you are old said the youth one would hardly suppose that youre ye was as steady as every e t you balanced an eel on the end of your nose what made you so awfully clever i have answered three questions and that is enough said his father dont give yourself airs do you think i can listen all day to such stuff be off or ill kick youd own stairs that is not said right said the caterpillar not quite right im afraid said alice timidly some of the words have got altered i tis wrong from beginning to end said the caterpillar decidedly and there was silence for some minutes the caterpillar was the first to speak whats i e do you want to be it asked o him not particular as to size alice hastily replied only one doesnt like changing so often you know i dont knows a id the caterpillar alices a id nothing she had never been so much contradicted in her life before and she felt thats he was losing her temper are you content now said the caterpillar well i should like to be a little larger sir if you wouldnt mind said alice three inches is such a wretched height to be i tis a very good height indeed said the caterpillar angrily rearing itself upright a sit spoke it was exactly three inches high but im not used to it pleaded poor alice in a piteous tone and she thought of herself i wish the creatures wouldnt be so easily offended youll get used to it in times a id the caterpillar and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again this time alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again in a minute or two the caterpillar took the hookah out o fits mouth and yawned once or twice and shook itself then it got down off the mushroom and crawled away in the grass merely remarking a sit we tones id e will make you grow taller and the others id e will make you grow shorter one side of what the others id e of what thought alice to herself of the mushroom said the caterpillar just as if she had asked it aloud and in another moment it was out of sight alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute trying to make out which were the two sides o fit and a sit was perfectly round she found this a very difficult question however at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand and now which is which she said to herself and nibbled a little of the righthand bit to try the effect the next moments he felt a violent blow underneath her chin it had struck her foot she was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change but she felt that there was no time to be lost as she was shrinking rapidly so shes e t to work at once to eats o me of the other bit her chin was pressed so closely against her foot that there was hardly room to open her mouth but shed id it at a stand managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit come my heads free at last said alice in a tone of delight which changed into alarm in another moment when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found all she could see when she looked down was an immense length of neck which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her what can all that green stuff be said alice and where have my shoulders got to and o hm poor hands how i sit i cant see you she was moving them about as she spoke but no result seemed to follow except a little shaking among the distant green leaves as there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her heads he tried together head down to them and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction like a serpents he had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag and was going to dive in among the leaves which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry a large pigeon had flown into her face and was beating her violently with its wings serpents c e am e d the pigeon im not a serpents a id alice indignantly let me alone serpent i say again repeated the pigeon but in a more subdued tone and added with a kind of sob ive tried every way and nothing seems to suit them i havent the least idea what youre talking about said alice ive tried the roots of trees an dive tried banks an dive tried hedges the pigeon went on without attending to her but those serpents theres no pleasing them alice was more and more puzzled but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the pigeon had finished as i fit wasnt trouble enough hatching the eggs said the pigeon but i must be on the look out for serpents night and day why i havent ada wink of sleep these three weeks im very sorry youve been annoyed said alice who was beginning to see its meaning and just as id taken the highest tree in the wood continued the pigeon raising its voice to a shriek and just as i was thinking i should be free of them at last they must needs come wriggling down from the sky ugh serpent but im not a serpent i tell you said alice im a im a well what are you said the pigeon i can see youre trying to invent something ii ma little girls a id alice rather doubtfully as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day a likely story indeed said the pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt ive seen a good many little girls in my time but never one with such a neck as that no no youre a serpent and theres no use denying it i suppose youll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg i have tasted eggs certainly said alice who was a very truthful child but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do you know i dont believe it said the pigeon but if theyd o why then theyre a kind of serpent thats all i can say this was such a new idea to alice thats he was quite silent for a minute or two which gave the pigeon the opportunity of adding youre looking for eggs i know that well enough and what does it matter to me whether youre a little girl or a serpent it matters a good deal to me said alice hastily but im not looking for eggs a sit happens and if i was i shouldnt want yours i dont like them raw well be off then said the pigeon in a sulky tone a sit settled down again into its nest alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it after a whiles he remembered thats he still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands and shes e t to work very carefully nibbling first a tone and then at the other and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height it was so long since she had been anything earth e right size that it felt quite strange at first but she got used to it in a few minutes and began talking to herself as usual come theres half my plan done now how puzzling all these changes are im never sure what im going to be from one minute to another however ive got back to my right size the next thing is to get into that beautiful garden how is that to be done i wonder as she said this she came suddenly upon an open place with a little house in it about four feet high whoever lives there thought alice itll never do to come upon them this size why i should frighten them out of their wits so she began nibbling at the righthand bit again and did not venture to go earth e house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high chapter vi pig and pepper for a minute or two she stood looking at the house and wondering what to do next when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery otherwise judging by his face only she would have called him a fish and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles it was opened by another footman in livery with around face and large eyes like a frog and both footmen alice noticed had powdered hair that curled a love their heads she felt very curious to know what it was all about and crept a little way out of the wood to listen the fish footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter nearly as large as himself and this he handed over to the others a in in a solemn tone for the duchess an invitation from the queen to play croquet the frog footman repeated in the same solemn tone only changing the order of the words a little from the queen an invitation for the duchess to play croquet then they both bowed low and their curls got entangled together alice laughed so much at this thats he had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her and when she next peeped out the fish footman was gone and the other was sitting on the ground earth e door staring stupidly up into the sky alice went timidly up to the door and knocked theres no sort of use in knocking said the footman and that for two reasons first because i month e same side of the door as you are secondly because theyre making such a noise inside no one could possibly hear you and certainly there was a most extraordinary noise going on within a constant howling and sneezing and every now and then a great crash as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces please then said alice how am it o get in there might be some sense in your knocking the footman went on without attending to her if we had the door between us for instance if you were inside you might knock and i could let you out you know he was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking and this alice thought decidedly uncivil but perhaps he cant help its he said to herself his eyes are so very nearly at the top of his head but at any rate he might answer questions how am it o get in she repeated aloud i shall i there the footman remarked till tomorrow at this moment the door of the house opened and a large plate came skimming out straight at the footmans head it just grazed his nose and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him or next day maybe the footman continued in the same tone exactly as if nothing had happened how am it o get in asked alice again in a louder tone are out o get in at all said the footman thats the first question you know it was no doubt only alice did not like to be told so its really dreadful she muttered to herself the way all the creatures argue its enough to drive one crazy the footmans e em e d to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark with variations i shall i there he said on and off for day sand days but what am it o do said alice anything you likes a id the footman and began whistling oh theres no use in talking to him said alice desperately hes perfectly idiotic and she opened the door and went in the door led right into a large kitchen which was full of smoke from one end to the other the duchess was sitting on a three legged stool in the middle nursing a baby the cook was leaning over the fire stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup theres certainly too much pepper in thats o up alices a id to herself as well as she could for sneezing there was certainly too much o fit in the air even the duchesss e e e d occasionally and as for the baby it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moments pause the only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze were the cook and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear please would you tell me said alice a little timidly for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first why your cat grins like that its a cheshire cat said the duchess and thats why pigs he said the last word with such sudden violence that alice quite jumped but shes a win another moment that it was addressed to the baby and not to hers o she took courage and went on again i didnt know that cheshire cats always grinned in fact i didnt know that cats could grin they all can said the duchess and most of em do i dont know o fan that do alices a id very politely feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation you dont know much said the duchess and thats a fact alice did not at all like the tone of this remark and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation whiles he was trying to fix o none the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the duchess and the baby the fire irons came first then followed a shower of saucepans plates and dishes the duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her and the baby was howling so much already that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not oh please mind what youre doing cried alice jumping up and down in an agony of terror oh there goes his precious nose as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it and very nearly carried it off if everybody minded their own business the duchesss a id in a hoarse growl the world would go round a deal faster than it does which would not be an advantage said alice who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge just think of what work it would make with the day and night you see the earth takes twenty four hours to turn round on its axis talking of axes said the duchess chop off her head alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook to see if she meant to take the hint but the cook was busily stirring the soup and seemed not to be listening so she went on again twenty four hours i think or i sit twelve i oh dont bother me said the duchess i never could abide figures and with thats he began nursing her child again singing a sort of lullaby to it as shed id so and giving it a violent shake at the end of every lines e a roughly to your little boy and beat him when he sneezes he only does it to annoy because he knows it teases chorus in which the cook and the baby joined wow wow wow while the duchesss an the second verse of the song she kept tossing the baby violently up and down and the poor little thing howled so that alice could hardly hearth e words i speak severely to my boy i beat him when he sneezes for he can thoroughly enjoy the pepper when he pleases chorus wow wow w o where you may nurse it a bit if you like the duchesss a id to alice flinging the baby at her as she spoke i must go and get ready to play croquet with the queen and she hurried out of the room the cook threw a frying pan after her as she went out but it just missed her alice caught the baby with some difficulty a sit was a queer shaped little creature and held out its arm sand legs in all directions just like a star fish thought alice the poor little thing was snorting like a steam engine when she caught it and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again so that altogether for the first minute or two it was as much as she could do to hold it as soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it which was to twist it up into a sort of knot and then keep tight hold o fits right ear and left foot so as to prevent its undoing itself she carried it out into the open air if i dont take this child away with me thought alice theyre sure to kill it in ada or two wouldnt it be murder to leave it behind she said the last words out loud and the little thing grunted in reply it had left off sneezing by this time dont grunt said alice thats not at all a proper way of expressing yourself the baby grunted again and alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it there could be no doubt that it ada very turn up nose much more like a snout than a real no seals o its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby altogether alice did not like the look of the thing at all but perhaps it was only sobbing she thought and looked into its eyes again to see if there were any tears no there were no tears if youre going to turn into a pig my dears a id alice seriously ill have nothing more to do with you mind now the poor little thing sobbed again or grunted it was impossible to say which and they went on for some while in silence alice was just beginning to think to herself now what am it o do with this creature when i get it home when it grunted again so violently thats he looked down into its face in some alarm this time there could be no mistake about it it was neither more nor less than a pig and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further so shes e t the little creature down and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood i fit had grown up she said to herself it would have made a dreadfully ugly child but it makes rather a handsome pig i think and she began thinking over other children she knew who might do very well as pig sand was just saying to herself if one only knew the right way to change them when she was a little startled by seeing the cheshire cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off the cat only grinned when its a w alice it looked good natured she thoughts till it had very long claws and a great many teeth so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect cheshire puss she began rather timidly as shed id not at all know whether it would like then am e however it only grinned a little wider come its pleased so far thought alice and she went on would you tell me please which way i ought to go from here that depends a good deal on where you want to get to said the cat i dont much care wheres a id alice then it doesnt matter which way you go said the cats o long as i get somewhere alice added as an explanation oh youre sure to do thats a id the cat if you only walk long enough alice felt that this could not be denied so she tried another question whats or to people live about here in that direction the cat said waving its right paw round lives a hatter and in that direction waving the other paw lives a march hare visit either you like theyre both mad but i dont want to go among mad people alice remarked oh you cant help thats a id the cat were all mad here im mad youre mad how do you know im mad said alice you must be said the cat or you wouldnt have come here alice didnt think that proved it at all however she went on and how do you know that youre mad to begin with said the cat a dogs not mad you grant that i suppose so said alice well then the cat went on you see a dog growls when its angry and wags its tail when its pleased now i growl when im pleased and wag my tail when im angry therefore im mad i call it purring not growling said alice call it what you likes a id the cat do you play croquet with the queen today i should like it very much said alice but i havent been invited yet youll seem e theres a id the cat and vanished alice was not much surprised at this she was getting so used to queer things happening whiles he was looking at the place where it had been it suddenly appeared again by the bye what became of the baby said the cat id nearly forgotten to ask it turned into a pig alice quietly said just as i fit had come back in a natural way i thought it would said the cat and vanished again alice waited a little half expecting to see it again but it did not appear and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the march hare was said to live ive seen hatters before she said to herself the march hare will be much them o t interesting and perhaps as this is may it wont be raving m ada t least not so m ada sit was in march as she said this she looked up and there was the cat again sitting on a branch of a tree did you say pig or fig said the cat i said pig replied alice and i wish you wouldnt keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly you make one quite giddy all right said the cat and this time it vanished quite slowly beginning with the end of the tail and ending with the grin which remained some time after theres to fit had gone we live often seen a cat without a grin thought alice but a grin without a cat its them o t curious thing i ever a win my life she had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the march hare she thought it must be the right house because the chimneys were shaped like ear sand the roof was thatched with fur it was so large a house thats he did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom and raised herself to about two feet high even then she walked up towards it rather timidly saying to herself suppose it should be raving mad after all i almost wish id gone to see the hatter instead chapter vii a mad tea party there was a table set out under a tree in front of the house and the march hare and the hatter were having tea at it a dormouse was sitting between them fast asleep and the other two were using it as a cushion resting their elbows on it and talking over its head very uncomfortable for the dormouse thought alice only a sits asleep i suppose it doesnt mind the table was a large one but the three were all crowded together a tone corner o fit no room no room they cried out when they saw alice coming theres plenty of room said alice indignantly and shes at down in a large arm chair a tone end of the table have some wine the march hare said in an encouraging tone alice looked all round the table but there was nothing on it but tea i dont see any wine she remarked there isnt any said the march hare then it wasnt very civil of out o offer it said alice angrily it wasnt very civil of out o sit down without being invited said the march hare i didnt know it was your table said alice its laid for a great many more than three your hair wants cutting said the hatter he had been looking at alice for some time with great curiosity and this wash is first speech you should learn not to make personal remarks alices a id with some severity its very rude the hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this but all he said was why is a raven like a writing desk come we shall have some fun now thought alice im glad theyve begun asking riddles i believe i can guess thats he added aloud do you meant hat you think you can find out the answer to it said the march hare exactly so said alice then you should say what you meant he march hare went on id o alice hastily replied at least at least i mean what i say thats the same thing you known o t the same thing a bit said the hatter you might just as well say that i see what i eat is the same thing as i eat what i see you might just as well say added the march hare that i like what i get is the same thing as i get what i like you might just as well say added the dormouse who seemed to be talking in his sleep that i breathe when i sleep is the same thing as i sleep when i breathe i tis the same thing with you said the hatter and here the conversation dropped and the party sat silent for a minute while alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing desks which wasnt much the hatter was the first to break the silence what day of the month i sit he said turning to alice he had taken his watch out of his pocket and was looking at it uneasily shaking it every now and then and holding it to his ear alice considered a little and then said the fourth two days wrong sighed the hatter i told you butter wouldnt suit the works he added looking angrily at the march hare it was the best butter the march hare meekly replied yes but some crumbs must have got in as well the hatter grumbled you shouldnt have put it in with the bread knife the march hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily then he dipped it into his cup of tea and looked at it again but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark it was the best butter you know alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity what a funny watch she remarked it tells the day of the month and doesnt tell what oclock i tis why should it muttered the hatter does your watch tell you what year i tis of course not alice replied very readily but thats because it stays the same year for such along time together which is just the case with mine said the hatter alice felt dreadfully puzzled the hatters remarks e em e d to have no sort of meaning in it and yet it was certainly english i dont quite understand you she said as politely as she could the dormouse is asleep again said the hatter and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose the dormouses o o its head impatiently and said without opening its eyes of course of course just what i was going to remark myself have you guessed the riddle yet the hatters a id turning to alice again no i give it up alice replied whats the answer i havent the slightest idea said the hatter nor i said the march hare alice sighed wearily i think you might do something better with the times he said than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers if you knew time as well as id o said the hatter you wouldnt talk about wasting it its him i dont know what you means a id alice of course you dont the hatters a id tossing his head contemptuously i daresay you never even spoke to time perhaps not alice cautiously replied but i know i have to beat time when i learn music ah that accounts for it said the hatter he wont stand beating now if you only kept on good terms with him hed do almost anything you liked with the clock for instance suppose it were nine oclock in the morning just time to begin lessons youd only have to whisper a hint to t i mean d round goes the clock in a twinkling half past one time for dinner i only wish it was the march hare said to itself in a whisper that would be grand certainly said alice thoughtfully but then i shouldnt be hungry for it you known o t at first perhaps said the hatter but you could keep it to half past one as long as you liked is that the way you manage alice asked the hatters o o his head mournfully not i he replied we quarrelled last march just before he went mad you know pointing with his tea spoon at the march hare it was at the great concert given by the queen of hearts and i had to sing twinkle twinkle little bat how i wonder what youre at you know the song perhaps ive heard something like it said alice it goes on you know the hatter continued in this way up above the world you fly like a tea tray in the sky twinkle twinkle here the dormouses o o itself and began singing in its sleep twinkle twinkle twinkle twinkle and went on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop well id hardly finished the first verses a id the hatter when the queen jumped up and bawled out hes murdering the time off with his head how dreadfully savage exclaimed alice and ever since that the hatter went on in a mournful tone he wont do a thing i ask its always six oclock now a bright idea came into alices head is that the reasons o many tea things are put ou theres he asked yes thats it said the hatter with a sigh its always tea t i mean d w even o time to wash the things between whiles then you keep m o v in ground i suppose said alice exactly so said the hatter as the things get used up but what happens when you come to the beginning again alice ventured to ask suppose we change the subject the march hare interrupted yawning im getting tired of this i vote the young lady tells us a story im afraid i dont know ones a id alice rather alarmed at the proposal then the dormouses hall they both cried wake up dormouse and they pinched it on both sides at once the dormouses owl opened his eyes i wasnt asleep he said in a hoarse feeble voice i heard every word you fellows were saying tell us a story said the march a eyes pleased o pleaded alice and be quick about it added the hatter or youll be asleep again before its done once upon a time there were three little sisters the dormouse began in a great hurry and their names were elsie lacie and tillie and they lived at the bottom of a well what did they live on said alice who always took a great interest in questions of eating and drinking they lived on treacle said the dormouse after thinking a minute or two they couldnt have done that you know alice gently remarked theyd have been ill so they were said the dormouse very ill alice tried to fancy to herself whats c an extraordinary ways of living would be like but it puzzled her too much so she went on but why did they live at the bottom of a well takes o me more tea the march hare said to a i c every earnestly ive had nothing yet alice replied in an offended tones o i cant take more you mean you cant take less said the hatter its very easy to take more than nothing nobody asked your opinion said alice whos making personal remarks now the hatter asked triumphantly alice did not quite know what to say to this so she helped herself to some tea and bread and butter and then turned to the dormouse and repeated her question why did they live at the bottom of a well the dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it and then said it was a treacle well theres no such thing alice was beginning very angrily but the hatter and the march hare went sh hand the dormouses x i x remarked if you cant be civil youd better finish the story for yourself no please go on alices a id very humbly i wont interrupt again i daresay there maybe one one indeed said the dormouse indignantly however he consented to go on and so these three little sisters they were learning to draw you know what did theyd raw said alice quite forgetting her promise treacle said the dormouse without considering at all this time i want a clean cup interrupted the hatter lets all move one place on he moved on a she spoke and the dormouse followed him the march a removed into the dormouses place and alice rather unwillingly took the place of the march hare the hatter was the only o new o got any advantage from the change and alice was a good deal worse off than before as the march hare had just upset the milk jug into his plate alice did not wish to offend the dormouse again so she began very cautiously but i dont understand where did theyd raw the treacle from you can draw water out of a water well said the hatters o i should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle well eh stupid but they were in the well alices a id to the dormouse not choosing to notice this last remark of course they were said the dormouse well in this answers o confused poor alice thats he let the dormouse go on for some time without interrupting it they were learning to draw the dormouse went on yawning and rubbing its eyes for it was getting very sleepy and theyd e w all manner of things everything that begins w i than m why w i than m said alice why not said the march hare alice was silent the dormouse had closed its eyes by this t i mean d was going off into a doze but on being pinched by the hatter it woke up again with a little shriek and went on that begins w i than m such as mouse traps and them o on and memory and muchness you know you say things are much of a muchness did you e verse e such a thing as a drawing of a muchness really now you ask me said a i c every much confused i dont think then you shouldnt talk said the hatter this piece of rudeness was more than alice could bear she got up in great disgust and walked off the dormouse fell asleep instantly and neither of the others took the least notice of her going though she looked back once or twice half hoping that they would call after her the last times hes a w them they were trying to put the dormouse into the teapot at any rate ill never go there again said alice as she picked her way through the wood its the stupidest tea party i ever was at in all my life just as she said this she noticed that one of the trees ada door leading right into it thats very curious she thought but everythings curious today i think i may as well go in at once and in she went once more she found herself in the long hall and close to the little glass table no will manage better this times he said to herself and began by taking the little golden key and unlocking the door that led into the garden then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom she had kept a piece o fit in her pocket till she was about a foot high then she walked down the little passage and then she found herself at last in the beautiful garden among the bright flower bed sand the cool fountains chapter viii the queens croquet ground a large rosetree stood earth e entrance of the garden the roses growing on it were white but there were three gardeners at it busily painting them red alice thought this a very curious thing and she went nearer to watch them and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say look out now five dont go splashing paint over me like that i couldnt help it said five in a sulky tone seven jogged my elbow on which seven looked up and said thats right five always lay the blame on others youd better not talk said five i heard the queens a only yesterday you deserved to be beheaded what for said the o new o had spoken first thats none of your business two said seven yes i tis his business said five and ill tell him it was for bringing the cook tulip roots instead of onions seven flung down his brush and had just begun well o fall the unjust things when his eye chanced to fall upon alice as she stood watching them and he checked himself suddenly the others looked round also and all of them bowed low would you tell me said alice a little timidly why you are painting those roses five and seven said nothing but looked at two two began in a low voice why the fact is you see miss this here ought to have been are d rosetree and we put a white one in by mistake and if the queen was to find it out we should all have our heads cut off you knows o you see miss were doing our best afore she comes to at this moment five who had been anxiously looking across the garden called out the queen the queen and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces there was a sound of many footsteps and alice looked round eager to see the queen first came ten soldiers carrying clubs these were all shaped like the three gardeners oblong and flat with their hands and feet at the corners next the ten courtiers these were ornamented a love with diamonds and walked two and two as the soldiers did after these came the royal children there were ten of them and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand in couples they were all ornamented with hearts next came the guests mostly kings and queens and among them alice recognised the white rabbit it was talking in a hurried nervous manner smiling at everything that was said and went by without noticing her then followed the knave of hearts carrying the kings crown on a crimson velvet cushion and last o fall this grand procession came the king and queen of hearts alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions and besides what would be the use of a procession thoughts he if people had all to lie down upon their faces so that they couldnt see its o she stood still wheres he w a sand waited when the procession came opposite to alice they all stopped and looked at her and the queens a id severely who is this she said it to the knave of hearts who only bowed and smiled in reply idiot said the queen tossing her head impatiently and turning to alices he went on whats your name child my name is alices o please your majesty said a i c every politely but she added to herself why theyre only a pack of cards after all i neednt be afraid of them and who are these said the queen pointing to the three gardeners who were x in ground the rosetree for you see as they were lying on their faces and the pattern on their backs was the same as theres to the pack she could not tell whether they were gardeners or soldiers or courtiers or three of he row children how should i knows a id alice surprised a the row courage its no business of mine the queen turned crimson with fury and after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast screamed off with her head off nonsense said a i c every loudly and decidedly and the queen was silent the king laid his hand upon her arm and timidly said consider my dears he is only a child the queen turned angrily away from him and said to the knave turn them over the knave did so very carefully with one foot get up said the queen in a shrill loud voice and the three gardeners instantly jumped up and began bowing to the king the queen the royal children and everybody else leave off that screamed the queen you make me giddy and then turning to the rosetree she went on what have you been doing here may it please your majesty said two in a very humble tone going down o none knee a she spoke we were trying i see said the queen who had meanwhile been examining the roses off with their heads and the procession moved on three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners who ran to alice for protection you shant be beheaded said alice and she put them into a large flower pot that stood earth e three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two looking for them and then quietly marched off after the others are their heads off shouted the queen their heads are gone i fit please your majesty the soldiers shouted in reply thats right shouted the queen can you play croquet the soldiers were silent and looked at alice as the question was evidently meant for her yes shouted alice come on then roared the queen and alice joined the procession wondering very much what would happen next it sits a very fine days a id a timid voice at her sides he was walking by the white rabbit who was peeping anxiously into her a c every said alice wheres the duchess hush hush said the rabbit in a low hurried tone he looked anxiously over his shoulder a she spoke and then raised himself upon tiptoe x this mouth close to here a and whispered shes under sentence of execution what for said alice did you say what a pity the rabbit asked no i didnt said alice i dont think its at all a pity i said what for she boxed the queens ears the rabbit began alice gave a little scream of laughter oh hush the rabbit whispered in a frightened tone the queen will hear you you see she came rather late and the queens a id get to your places shouted the queen in a voice of thunder and people began running about in all directions tumbling up against each other however they got settled down in a minute or two and the game began alice thoughts he had never seen such a curious croquet ground in her life it was all ridges and furrows the balls were live hedgehogs the mallets live flamingoes and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet to make the arches the chief difficulty alice found at first was in managing her flamingo she succeeded in getting its body tucked away comfortably enough under her arm with its legs hanging down but generally just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head it would twist itself round and look up in her face with such a puzzled expression thats he could not help bursting out laughing and when she had got its head down and was going to begin again it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself and was in the act of crawling away besides all this there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to and as the doubled up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground alices o on came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed the players all played at once without waiting for turns quarrelling all the while and fighting for the hedgehogs and in a very short time the queen was in a furious passion and went stamping about and shouting off with his head or off with her head about once in a minute alice began to feel very uneasy to be sure she had not as yet ada x dispute with the queen but she knew that it might happen any minute and then thoughts he what would become of me theyre dreadfully fond of beheading people here the great wonder is that theres any one left a lives he was looking about for some way of escape and wondering whether she could get away without being seen when she noticed a curious appearance in the air it puzzled her very much at first but after watching it a minute or two she made it out to be a grin and she said to herself its the cheshire cat now i shall have somebody to talk to how are you getting on said the cat as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak with alice waited till the eyes appeared and then nodded its no use speaking to its he thought till its ears have come o rat least one of them in another minute the whole head appeared and then alice put down her flamingo and began an account of the game feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her the cat seemed to think that there was enough o fit now in sight and no more o fit appeared i dont think they play at all fairly alice began in rather a complaining tone and they all quarrel so dreadfully one cant hear oneself speak and theyd on t seem to have any rules in particular at least if there are nobody attends to them and youve no idea how confusing i tis all the things being alive for instance theres the arch ive got to go through next walking about at the o there do the ground and i should have croqueted the queens hedgehog just now only it ran away when its a w mine coming how do you like the queens a id the cat in a low voice not at all said alices hes so extremely just then she noticed that the queen was close behind her listening so she went on likely to win that its hardly worth while finishing the game the queens mile d and passed on who are you talking to said the king going up to alice and looking at the cats head with great curiosity its a friend of mine a cheshire cat said alice allow met o introduce it i dont like the look o fit at all said the king however it may kiss my hand i fit likes id rather not the cat remarked dont be impertinent said the king and dont look at me like that he got behind alice a she spoke a cat may look a taking said alice ive read that in some book but i dont remember where well it must be removed said the king very decidedly and he called the queen who was passing at the moment my dear i wish you would have this cat removed the queen had only o new a of settling all difficulties great or small off with his heads he said without even looking round ill fetch the executioner myself said the king eagerly and he hurried off alice thoughts he might as well go back and see how the game was going on as she heard the queens voice in the distance screaming with passion she had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns and shed id not like the look of things at a last he game was in such confusion thats he never knew whether it wash e turn or not so she went in search of her hedgehog the hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog which seemed to alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other the only difficulty was that her flamingo was gone across to the others id e of the garden where alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree by the times he had caught the flamingo and brought it back the fight was over and both the hedgehogs were out of sight but it doesnt matter much thought alice as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground so she tucked it away under her arm that it might not escape again and went back for a little more conversation with her friend when she got back to the cheshire cats he was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it there was a dispute going on between the executioner the king and the queen who were all talking at once while all theres t were quite silent and looked very uncomfortable the moment alice appeared she was appealed to by all three to settle the question and they repeated their arguments to her though as they all spoke at once she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said the executioners argument was that you couldnt cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from that he had never had to do such a thing before and he wasnt going to begin a this time of life the kings argument was that anything that ada head could be beheaded and that you werent to talk nonsense the queens argument was that if something wasnt done about it in less than no times hed have everybody executed all round it was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious alice could think of nothing else to say but it belongs to the duchess youd better ask her about it shes in prison the queens a id to the executioner fetch her here and the executioner went off like a narrow the cats head began fading away the moment he was gone and by the time he had come back with the duchess it had entirely disappeared so the king and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it while theres to the party went back to the game chapter ix them o c turtles story you cant think how glad i am to see you again you dear old things a id the duchess as she tucked her arm affectionately into alices and they walked off together alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper and thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made hers o savage when they met in the kitchen when im a duchesss he said to herself not in a very hopeful tone though i wont have any pepper in my kitchen at all soup does very well without maybe its always pepper that makes people hot tempered she went on very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule and vinegar that makes them sour and camomile that makes them bitter and and barley sugar and such things that make children sweet tempered i only wish people knew that then they wouldnt be so stingy about it you knows he had quite forgotten the duchess by this t i mean d was a little startled when she heard her voice close to here a youre thinking about something my dear and that makes you forget to talk i cant tell you just now what the moral of that is but i shall remember it in a bit perhaps it hasnt one alice ventured to remark tut tut child said the duchess everythings got a moral if only you can find it and she squeezed herself up closer to alices side as she spoke alice did not much like keeping so close to her first because the duchess was very ugly and secondly because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon alices shoulder and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin however shed id not like to be rude so she bore it as well as she could the games going on rather better now she said by way of keeping up the conversation a little tis so said the duchess and the moral of that is oh tis love tis love that makes the world go round somebody said alice whispered that its done by everybody minding their own business ah well it means much the same things a id the duchess digging her sharp little chin into alices shoulder as she added and the moral of that is take care of these sea d the sounds will take care of themselves how fond she is of finding morals in things alice thought to herself i daresay youre wondering why i dont put my arm round your waist the duchesss a id after a pause the reason is that im doubtful about the temper of your flamingo shall i try the experiment he might bite alice cautiously replied not feeling at all anxious to have the experiment tried very true said the duchess flamingoes and mustard both bite and the moral of that is birds of a feather flock together only mustard isnt a bird alice remarked right as usual said the duchess what a clear way you have of putting things its a mineral i think said alice of course i tis said the duchess who seemed ready to agree to everything that alices a id theres a large mustard mine near here and the moral of that is the more there is of mine the less there is of yours oh i know exclaimed alice who had not attended to this last remark its a vegetable it doesnt look like one but i tis i quite agree with you said the duchess and the moral of that is be what you would seem to be or if youd like it put more simply never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise i think i should understand that better alices a id very politely if i had it written down but i cant quite follow it as you say it thats nothing to what i could say if i chose the duchess replied in a pleased tone pray dont trouble yourself to say it any longer than thats a id alice oh dont talk about trouble said the duchess i make you a present of everything ive said as yet a cheap sort of present thought alice im glad theyd on t give birthday presents like that but shed id not venture to say it out loud thinking again the duchess asked with another dig of her sharp little chin ive a right to think said alice sharply for she was beginning to feel a little worried just about as much right said the duchess as pigs have to fly and them x there to alices great surprise the duchesss voice died away even in the middle of her favourite word moral and t hear m that was linked into hers began to tremble alice looked up and theres too d the queen in front of them with her arms folded frowning like a thunderstorm a fine day your majesty the duchess began in a low weak voice now i give you fair warning shouted the queen stamping on the ground as she spoke either you or your head must be of fan d that in about half no time take your choice the duchess took her choice and was gone in a moment lets go on with the game the queens a id to alice and alice was too much frightened to say a word but slowly followed her back to the croquet ground the other guests had taken advantage of the queens absence and were resting in the shade however the moment they saw her they hurried back to the game the queen merely remarking that a moments delay would cost them their lives all the time they were playing the queen never left off quarrelling with the other players and shouting off with his head or off with her head those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers who of course had to leave off being arches to do this so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left and all the players except the king the queen and alice were in custody and under sentence of execution then the queen left off quite out of breath and said to alice have you seen them o c turtle yet no said alice i dont even know what a mock turtle i sits the thing mock turtles o up is made from said the queen i never a won e or heard of ones a id alice come on then said the queen and he shall tell you his history as they walked off together alice heard the kings a in a low voice to the company generally you a real pardoned come thats a good things he said to herself for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the queen had ordered theyve x soon came upon a gryphon lying fast asleep in the sun if you dont know what a gryphon is look at the picture up lazy things a id the queen and take this young lady to see them o c turtle and to hear his history i must go back and see after some executions i have ordered and she walked off leaving alice alone with the gryphon alice did not quite like the look of the creature but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage queens o she waited the gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes then it watched the queen till she was out of sight then it chuckled what fun said the gryphon half to itself half to alice what is the fun said alice why she said the gryphon its all her fancy that they never executes nobody you know come on everybody says come on here thought alice as she went slowly after it i never was so ordered about in all my life never they had not gone far before they saw them o c turtle in the distance sitting ada d lonely on a little ledge of rock and as they came nearer alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break she pitied him deeply what is his sorrows he asked the gryphon and the gryphon answered very nearly in the same words as before its all his fancy that he hasnt got no sorrow you know come on so they went up to them o c turtle who looked at them with large eyes full of tears but said nothing this here young lady said the gryphon she wants for to know your history shed o ill tell it hers a id them o c turtle in a deep hollow tones it down both of you and dont speak a word t i live finished so they sat down and nobody spoke for some minutes alice thought to herself i dont see how he can even finish if he doesnt begin but she waited patiently once said them o c turtle at last with a deep sigh i was a real turtle these words were followed by a very long silence broken only by an occasional exclamation of hjckrrh from the gryphon and the constant heavy sobbing of them o c turtle alice was very nearly getting up and saying thank you sir for your interesting story but she could not help thinking there must be more to comes o shes at still and said nothing when we were little them o c turtle went on at last more calmly though still sobbing a little now and then we went to school in these a the master was an old turtle we used to call him tortoise why did you call him tortoise if he wasnt one alice asked we called him tortoise because he taught us said them o c turtle angrily really you a every dull you ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question added the gryphon and then they both sat silent and looked at poor alice who felt ready to sink into the earth at last the gryphon said to them o c turtle drive on old fellow dont be all day about it and he went on in these words yes we went to school in these a though you maynt believe it i never said i didnt interrupted alice youd id said them o c turtle hold your tongue added the gryphon before alice could speak again them o c turtle went on we had the best of educations in fact we went to school every day ive been to ada school too said alice you neednt be so proud as all that with extras asked them o c turtle a little anxiously yes said alice we learned french and music and washing said them o c turtle certainly not said alice indignantly ah then yours wasnt a really good school said them o c turtle in a tone of great relief now at ours they ada t the end of the bill french music and washing extra you couldnt have wanted it much said alice living at the bottom of these a i couldnt afford to learn it said them o c turtle with a sigh i only took the regular course what was that inquired alice reeling and writhing of course to begin with them o c turtle replied and then the different branches of arithmetic ambition distraction uglification and derision i never heard of uglification alice ventured to say what i sit the gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise what never heard of uglifying it exclaimed you know what to beautify is i suppose yes said alice doubtfully it means to make anything prettier well then the gryphon went on if you dont know what to uglify is you are a simpleton alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about its o she turned to them o c turtle and said w hate x e had out o learn well there was mystery them o c turtle replied counting off the subjects on his flappers mystery ancient and modern with seaography then drawling the drawling master was an old conger eel that used to come once a week he taught us drawling stretching and fainting in coils what was that likes a id alice well i cant show it you myself them o c turtles a id im too stiff and the gryphon never learnt it hadnt times a id the gryphon i went to the classics master though he was an old crab he was i never went to him them o c turtles a id with a sigh he taught laughing and grief they used to says o he did so he did said the gryphon sighing in his turn and both creatures hid their faces in their paw sand how many hours ada did youd o lessons said alice in a hurry to change the subject ten hours the first days a id them o c turtle nine the next and soon what a curious plan exclaimed alice thats the reason theyre called lessons the gryphon remarked because they lessen from day today this was quite a new idea to alice and she thought it over a little before she made her next remark then the eleventh day must have been a holiday of course it was said them o c turtle and how did you manage on the twelfth alice went on eagerly thats enough about lessons the gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone tell her something about the games now chapter x the lobster quadrille them o c turtles i hed deeply and drew the back of one flapper across his eyes he looked at alice and tried to speak but for a minute or two sobs choked his voices am e as if eh ada bone in his throat said the gryphon and its e t to work shaking him and punching him in the back at last them o c turtle recovered his voice and with tears running down his cheeks he went on again you may not have lived much under these a i havent said alice and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster alice began to say i once tasted but checked herself hastily and said no never so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a lobster quadrille is no indeed said alice whats or to a dance i sit why said the gryphon you first form into a line along these a shore two lines cried them o c turtles e a x turtles salmon and soon then when youve cleared all the jelly fish out of the way that generally takes some time interrupted the gryphon you advance twice each with a lobster as a partner cried the gryphon of course them o c turtles a id advance twice set to partners change lobsters and retire in same order continued the gryphon then you know them o c turtle went on youth row the the lobsters shouted the gryphon with a bound into the air as far out to sea as you can swim after them screamed the gryphon turn a somersault in these a cried them o c turtle capering wildly about change lobsters again yelled the gryphon at the top o fits voice back to land again and thats all the first figures a id them o c turtle suddenly dropping his voice and the two creatures who had been jumping about like mad things all this times at down again very sadly and quietly and looked at alice it must be a very pretty dance said alice timidly would you like to see a little o fits a id them o c turtle very much indeed said alice come lets try the first figures a id them o c turtle to the gryphon we can do without lobsters you know which shall sing oh o using said the gryphon ive forgotten the words so they began solemnly dancing round and round alice every now and then treading on her toes when they passed too close and waving their forepaws to mark the time while them o c turtles an this very slowly and sadly will you walk a little faster said a whiting to a snail theres a porpoise close behind sand hes treading on my tails e e how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance they are waiting on the shingle will you c o mean d join the dance will you wont you will you wont you will you join the dance will you wont you will you wont you wont you join the dance you can really have no notion how delightful it will be when they take us up and throw us with the lobsters out to sea but the snail replied too far too far and gave a look askance said he thanked the whiting kindly but he would not join the dance would not could not would not could not would not join the dance would not could not would not could not could not join the dance what matters it how far we go his scaly friend replied there is another shore you know upon the others id e the further off from england the nearer is to france then turn not pale beloved snail but c o mean d join the dance will you wont you will you wont you will you join the dance will you wont you will you wont you wont you join the dance thank you its a very interesting dance to watch said alice feeling very glad that it was over at a stand id o so like that curious song about the whiting o has to the whiting said them o c turtle they youve seen them of course yes said alice ive often seen them at dinn she checked herself hastily i dont know where dinn maybe said them o c turtle but if youve seen them so often of course you know what theyre like i believe so alice replied thoughtfully they have their tails in their mouths and theyre a love crumbs youre wrong about the crumbs said them o c turtle crumbs would all wash off in these a but they have their tails in their mouths and the reason is here them o c turtle yawned and sh this eyes tell her about the reason and all that he said to the gryphon the reason is said the gryphon that they would go with the lobsters to the dance so they got thrown out to sea so they had to fall along ways o they got their tails fast in their mouths so they couldnt get them out again thats all thank you said alice its very interesting i never knew so much about a whiting before i can tell you more than that if you likes a id the gryphon do you know why its called a whiting i never thought about it said alice why it does the boots and shoes the gryphon replied very solemnly alice was thoroughly puzzled does the boots and shoes she repeated in a wondering tone why what are your shoes done with said the gryphon i mean what makes them so shiny alice looked down at them and considered a little before she gave her answer theyre done with blacking i believe boots and shoes under these a the gryphon went on in a deep voice are done with a whiting now you know and what are they made of alice asked in a tone of great curiosity soles and eels of course the gryphon replied rather impatiently any shrimp could have told youth at if id been the whiting said alice whose thoughts were still running on the song id have said to the porpoise keep back please we dont want you with us they were obliged to have him with them them o c turtles a id no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise wouldnt it really said alice in a tone of great surprise of course not said them o c turtle why if a fish came to mean d told m eh e was going a journey i should say with what porpoise dont you mean purpose said alice i mean what i say them o c turtle replied in an offended tone and the gryphon added come lets ears o me of your adventures i could tell you my adventures beginning from this morning said alice a little timidly but its no use going back to yesterday because i was a different person then explain all thats a id them o c turtle no not he adventures first said the gryphon in an impatient tone explanations takes c a dreadful times o alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the white rabbits he was a little nervous about it just at first the two creatures got so close to her one on each side and opened their eye sand mouths so very wide but she gained courage as she went on her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating you are old father william to the caterpillar and the words all coming different and then them o c turtle drew along breath and said thats very curious its all about as curious a sit can be said the gryphon it all came different them o c turtle repeated thoughtfully i should like to hear her try and repeat something now tell her to begin he looked at the gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over alices t and up and repeat tis the voice of the sluggard said the gryphon how the creatures order one about and make one repeat lessons thought alice i might as well beat school at once however she got up and began to repeat it but her head was so full of the lobster quadrille thats he hardly knew whats he was saying and the words c am every queer indeed tis the voice of the lobster i heard him declare you have baked met o o brown i must sugar my hair as a duck with its eyelids so he with his nose trims his belt and his buttons and turns ou this to e slate editions continued as follows when the sands a real dry he is gay as a lark and will talk in contemptuous tones of the shark but when the tide rises and sharks are around his voice has a timid and tremulous sound thats different from what i used to say when i was a child said the gryphon well i never heard it before said them o c turtle but it sounds uncommon nonsense alices a id nothing she had sat down with her face in her hands wondering if anything would ever happen in a natural way again i should like to have it explained said them o c turtles he cant explain it said the gryphon hastily go on with the next verse but about his toes them o c turtle persisted how could he turn them out with his nose you know its the first position in dancing alices a id but was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing and longed to change the subject go on with the next verse the gryphon repeated impatiently it begins i passed by his garden alice did not dare to disobey though she felt sure it would all come wrong and she went on in a trembling voice i passed by his garden and marked with one eye how the o w land the panther were sharing a pie later editions continued as follows the panther took pie crust and gravy and meat while the owl had the dish a sits share of the treat when the pie was all finished the owl as a boon was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon while the panther received knife and fork with a growl and concluded the banquet what is the use of repeating all thats t x them o c turtle interrupted if you dont explain it as you go on its by far them o t confusing thing i ever heard yes i think youd better leave off said the gryphon and alice was only too glad to do so shall we try another figure of the lobster quadrille the gryphon went o nor would you like them o c turtle to sing you a song oh a song please if them o c turtle would be so kind alice replied so eagerly that the gryphon said in a rather offended tone hm no accounting for tastes sing her turtles o up will you old fellow them o c turtles i hed deeply and began in a voice sometimes choked with sobs to sing this beautiful soup so rich and green waiting in a hot tureen who for such dainties would not stoop soup of the evening beautiful soup soup of the

and them o c turtle had just begun to repeat it when a cry of the trials beginning was heard in the distance come on cried the gryphon and taking alice by the hand it hurried off without waiting for the end of the song what trial i sit alice panted as she ran but the gryphon only answered come on and ran the faster while more and more faintly came carried on the breeze that followed them the melancholy words soo oop of the e e evening beautiful beautiful soup chapter xi who stole the tarts the king and queen of hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived with a great crowd assembled about them all sorts of little birds and beasts as we last he whole pack of cards the knave was standing before them in chains with a soldier on each side to guard him and earth e king was the white rabbit with a trumpet i none hand and a scroll of parchment in the other in t every middle of the court was a table with a large dish of tarts upon it they looked so good that it made alice quite hungry to look at them i wish theyd get the trial done she thought and hand round the refreshments but there seemed to be no chance of this so she began looking at everything about her to pass away the time alice had never been in a court of justice before but she had read about them in books and she was quite pleased to find thats he knew then am e of nearly everything there thats the judge she said to herself because of his great wig the judge by the way was the king and a she wore his crown over the wig look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did i the did not look at all comfortable and it was certainly not becoming and thats the jury box thought alice and those twelve creatures she was obliged to say creatures you see because some of them were animals and some were birds i suppose they are the jurors she said this last word two or three times over to herself being rather proud o fit for she thought and rightly too that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning o fit at all however jurymen would have done just as well the twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates what are they doing alice whispered to the gryphon they cant have anything to put down yet before the trials begun theyre putting down their names the gryphon whispered in reply for earth e should forget them before the end of the trial stupid things alice began in aloud indignant voice but she stopped hastily for the white rabbit cried out silence in the court and the king put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round to make out who was talking alice could see as well as if she were looking over their shoulders that all the jurors were writing down stupid things on their slates and she could even make out that one of them didnt know how to spell stupid and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him a nice muddle their slatesll be in before the trials over thought alice one of the jurors ada pencil that squeaked this of course alice could not stand and she went round the court and got behind him and very soon found an opportunity of taking it a ways he did its o quickly that the poor little juror it was bill the lizard could not make out at all what had become o fits o after hunting all about for i the was obliged to write with one finger for theres to the day and this was of very little sea sit left no mark on the slate herald read the accusation said the king on this the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and then unrolled the parchment scroll and read as follows the queen of hearts she made some tarts all on a summer day the knave of hearts he stole those tarts and took them quite away consider your verdict the kings a id to the jury not yet not yet the rabbit hastily interrupted theres a great deal to come before that call the first witness said the king and the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and called out first witness the first witness was the hatter he came in with a teacup i none hand and a piece of bread and butter in the other i beg pardon your majesty he began for bringing these in but i hadnt quite finished my tea when i was sent for you ought to have finished said the king when did you begin the hatter looked at the march hare who had followed him into the court arm in arm with the dormouse fourteenth of march i think it wash e said fifteenth said the march hare sixteenth added the dormouse write that down the kings a id to the jury and the jury eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates and then added them up and reduced the answer to shillings and pence take off your hat the kings a id to the hatter it isnt mine said the hatters to e the king exclaimed turning to the jury who instantly made a memorandum of the fact i keep them to sell the hatter added as an explanation ive none of my own im a hatter here the queen put on her spectacles and began staring at the hatter who turned pale and fidgeted give your evidence said the king and dont be nervous or ill have you executed on the spot this did not seem to encourage the witness at all he kept shifting from one foot to the other looking uneasily at the queen and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread and butter just at this moment alice felt a very curious sensation which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was she was beginning to grow larger again and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court but on second thoughts she decided to remain wheres he was as long as there was room for her i wish you wouldnt squeeze so said the dormouse who was sitting next to her i can hardly breathe i cant help it said a i c every meekly im growing youve no right to x o wheres a id the dormouse dont talk nonsense said alice more boldly you know youre growing too yes but i grow at a reasonable pace said the dormouse not in that ridiculous fashion and he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the others id e of the court all this time the queen had never left off staring at the hatter and just as the dormouse crossed the court she said to one of the officers of the court bring met he list of the singers in the last concert on which the wretched hatter trembled so that he shook both his shoes off give your evidence the king repeated angrily or ill have you executed whether youre nervous or not im a poor many our majesty the hatter began in a trembling voice and i hadnt begun my tea not above a week or so and what with the bread and butter getting so thin and the twinkling of the tea the twinkling of the whats a id the king it began with the tea the hatter replied of course twinkling begins w i thats a id the king sharply do you take me for a dunce go on im a poor man the hatter went on and most things twinkled after that only the march hare said i didnt the march hare interrupted in a great hurry youd id said the hatter i deny it said the march hare he denies it said the king leave out that part well at any rate the dormouses a id the hatter went on looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too but the dormouse denied nothing being fast asleep after that continued the hatter i cut some more bread and butter but what did the dormouses a one of the jury asked that i cant remember said the hatter you must remember remarked the king or ill have you executed the miserable hatter dropped his teacup and bread and butter and went down o none knee im a poor many our majesty he began youre a very poor speaker said the king here one of the guinea pigs cheered and was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court as that is rather a hard word i will just explain to you how it was done they ada large canvas bag which tied pat the mouth with strings into this they slipped the guinea pig head first and then sat upon it im glad ive seen that done thought alice ive so often read in the newspapers at the end of trials there was some attempts at applause which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court and i never understood what it meant till now if thats all you know about it you may stand down continued the king i cant go no lower said the hatter i month e floor a sit is then you may sit down the king replied here the other guinea pig cheered and was suppressed come that finished the guinea pigs thought alice now we shall get on better id rather finish my tea said the hatter w i than anxious look at the queen who was reading the list of singers you may go said the king and the hatter hurriedly left the court without even waiting top this shoes on and just take his head off outside the queen added to one of the officers but the hatter was out of sight before the officer could get to the door call the next witness said the king the next witness was the duchesss cook she carried the pepper box in her hand and alice guessed who it w a seven before she got into the court by the way the people earth e door began sneezing all at once give your evidence said the kings an t said the cook the king looked anxiously at the white rabbit who said in a low voice your majesty must cross examine this witness well if i must i must the kings a id with a melancholy air and after folding his arm sand frowning at the cook till his eyes were nearly out of sight he said in a deep voice what are tarts made of pepper mostly said the cook treacle said asleep voice behind her collar that dormouse the queen shrieked out behead that dormouse turn that dormouse out of court suppress him pinch him off with his whiskers for some minutes the whole court was in confusion getting the dormouse turned out and by the time they had settled down again the cook had disappeared never mind said the king w i than air of great relief call the next witness and he added in an undertone to the queen really my dear you must cross examine the next witness it quite makes my forehead ache alice watched the white rabbit a she fumbled over the list feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like for they havent got much evidence yet she said to herself imagine her surprise when the white rabbit read out at the top of his shrill little voice then am e alice chapter xii alices evidence here cried alice quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes and she jumped up in such a hurry thats he tipped over the jury box with the edge of her skirt upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below and there they lay sprawling about reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before oh i beg your pardon she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay and began picking them up again as quickly as she could for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head and she ada vague sort of i death at they must be collected at once and put back into the jury box or they would die the trial cannot proceed said the king in a very grave voice until all the jurymen are back in their proper places all he repeated with great emphasis looking hard at alice a she said do alice looked at the jury box and saw that in her haste she had put the lizard in head downwards and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way being quite unable to move she soon got it out again and put it right not that it signifies much she said to herself i should think it would be quite as much use in the t i alone way past he other as soon as the jury ada little recovered from the shock of being upset and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident all except the lizard who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open gazing up in t other o of of the court what do you know about this business the kings a id to alice nothing said alice nothing whatever persisted the king nothing whatever said alice thats very important the kings a id turning to the jury they were just beginning to write this down on their slates when the white rabbit interrupted unimportant your majesty means of course he said in a very respectful tone but frowning and making faces at him a she spoke unimportant of course i meant the king hastily said and went on to himself in an undertone important unimportant unimportant important as if he were trying which word sounded best some of the jury wrote it down important and some unimportant alice could see this as she was near enough to look over their slates but it doesnt matter a its he thought to herself at this moment the king who had been for some time busily writing in his note book cackled out silence and read out from his book rule forty two all persons more than a mile high to leave the court everybody looked at alice im not a mile high said alice you are said the king nearly two miles high added the queen well i shant go at any rate said alice besides thats not a regular rule you invented it just no wits the oldest rule in the books a id the king then it ought to be number ones a id alice the king turned pale and sh this note book hastily consider your verdict he said to the jury in a low trembling voice theres more evidence to come yet please your majesty said the white rabbit jumping up in a great hurry this paper has just been picked up whats in it said the queen i havent opened it yet said the white rabbit but it seems to be a letter written by the prisoner to to somebody it must have been thats a id the king unless it was written to nobody which isnt usual you know who i sit directed to a i done of the jurymen it isnt directed at all said the white rabbit in fact theres nothing written on the outside he unfolded the paper a she spoke and added it isnt a letter after all its a set of verses are they in the prisoners handwriting asked another of the jurymen no theyre not said the white rabbit and thats the queerest thing about it the jury all looked puzzled he must have imitated somebody elses hands a id the king the jury all brightened up again please your majesty said the knave i didnt write it and they cant prove i did theres no name signed at the end if you didnt sign it said the king that only makes the matter worse you must have meant some mischief or else youd have signed your name like an honest man there was a general clapping of hands at this it was the first really clever thing the king had said that day that proves his guilt said the queen it proves nothing of the sorts a id alice why you dont even know what theyre about read them said the king the white rabbit put on his spectacles wheres hall i begin please your majesty he asked begin at the beginning the kings a id gravely and go on till you come to the end then stop these were the verses the white rabbit read they told me you had been to her and mentioned met o him she gave me a good character but said i could not swim he sent them word i had not gone we know it to be true if she should push the matter on what would become of you i gave her one they gave him two you gave us three or more they all returned from him to you thought he were mine before if i or she should chance to be involved in this affair he trusts to out o set them free exactly as we were my notion was that you had been before she had this fit an obstacle that came between him and ourselves and it dont let him knows he liked them best for this must ever be a secret kept from all theres t between yourself and me thats them o t important piece of evidence weve heard yet said the king rubbing his hands son o w let the jury i fan one of them can explain it said alices he had grown so large in the last few minutes thats he wasnt a bit afraid of interrupting him ill give him sixpence i dont believe theres an atom of meaning in it the jury all wrote down on their slates she doesnt believe theres an atom of meaning in it but none of them attempted to explain the paper if theres no meaning in it said the king that saves a world of trouble you know as we neednt try to find any and yet i dont know he went on spreading out the verses on his knee and looking at them with one eye i seem to see some meaning in them after all said i could not swim you cant swim can you he added turning to the knave the knave shook his heads a d x do i look like i the said which he certainly did not being made entirely of cardboard all right so far said the king and he went on muttering over the verses to himself we know it to be true thats the jury of course i gave her one they gave him two why that must be what he did with the tarts you know but it goes on they all returned from him to you said alice why there they are said the king triumphantly pointing to the tarts on the table nothing can be clearer than that then again before she had this fit you never had fits my dear i think he said to the queen never said the queen furiously throwing an inkstand at the lizard as she spoke the unfortunate little bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger a she found it made no mark x then o w hastily began again using the ink that was trickling down his face as long a sit lasted then the words dont fit you said the king looking round the court with a smile there was a dead silence its a pun the king added in an offended tone and everybody laughed let the jury consider their verdict the kings a id for about the twentieth time that day no no said the queen sentence first verdict afterwards stuff and nonsense said alice loudly the idea of having the sentence first hold your tongue said the queen turning purple i wont said alice off with her head the queen shouted at the top of her voice nobody moved who cares for you said alices he had grown to her full size by this time youre nothing but a pack of cards at this the whole pack rose up into the air and came flying down upon hers he gave a little scream half of fright and half of anger and tried to beat them of fan d found herself lying on the bank with her head in the lap of her sister who was gently brushing a ways o me dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face wake up alice dears a id her sister why what along sleepy ou v e had oh ive had such a curious dream said alice and she told her sister as well as she could remember them all these strange adventures of hers that you have just been reading about and when she had finished her sister kissed her and said it was a curious dream dear certainly but now run into your tea its getting late so alice got up and ran off thinking whiles her an as well she might what a wonderful dream it had been but her sisters at still just as she left her leaning her head on her hand watching the setting sun and thinking of little alice and all her wonderful adventures till she too began dreaming after a fashion and this wash e dream first she dreamed of little alice herself and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers she could hearth every tones of her voice and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that would always get into here ye sand still as she listened or seemed to listen the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her little sisters dream the long grass rustled at her feet as the white rabbit hurried by the frightened mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool she could hearth e rattle of the teacups as the march hare and his friends shared their never ending meal and the shrill voice of the queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution once more the pig baby was sneezing on the duchesss knee while plates and dishes crashed around it once more the shriek of the gryphon the squeaking of the lizards slate pencil and the choking of the suppressed guinea pigs filled the air mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable mock turtles o shes at on with closed eye sand half believed herself in wonderland though she knew she had but to open them again and all would change to dull reality the grass would be only rustling in the wind and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep bells and the queens shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy and the sneeze of the baby the shriek of the gryphon and all the other queer noises would changes he knew to the confused clamour of the busy farm yard while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of them o c turtles heavy sobs lastly she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would in the after time be herself a grown woman and how she would keep through all her riper years the simple and loving heart of her childhood and how she would gather about her other little children and make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale perhaps even with the dream of wonderland of long ago and how she would feel w it hall their simple sorrows and find a pleasure in all their simple joys remembering he row child life and the happy summer days the
